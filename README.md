# Process Scheduling Simulator
### Operating System Coursework

This Java code is a simulation of three process scheduling algorithm. 
1. First-Come First-Served (FCFS)
2. Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
3. Round Robin

The program generates random burst times for a given number of processes and calculates the waiting time and turnaround time for each process. Finally, it displays the average waiting time and average turnaround time.

## Usage
To use the code, compile and run the Main.java file of the desired algorythm in a Java IDE or from the command line. The user will be prompted to enter the number of processes and the minimum and maximum burst time. The program will then generate and display the data for each process.

## Requirements
The code requires Java 8 or higher to run and uses the following packages:
* java.util.Random
* java.util.Scanner
* java.util.Arrays
* java.util.LinkedList;

## Results
The output of the program includes a table showing the process ID, burst time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process, as well as the average waiting time and average turnaround time.
