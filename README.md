# Process Scheduling Simulator
Operating System Coursework

This Java code is a simulation of three process scheduling algorithm. 
1.First-Come First-Served (FCFS)
2.Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
3.Round Robin
The program generates random burst times for a given number of processes and calculates the waiting time and turnaround time for each process. Finally, it displays the average waiting time and average turnaround time.
